Above picture represents two box plots that compares the fares of male and female.
As seen Males fares are high which ranging from 10 - 30 and outliers are in 500 and we can also see there are same outliers in female fares.
Female fares starts ranging from 20 to 60, most of the whisker of males shows fare costing 10 and whisker for females it shows 30.
The over boxplots shows males average cost is low and females are more but the outliers mostly remains same for both of them.
